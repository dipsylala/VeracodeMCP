# Veracode MCP Server Testing Guide

This document provides comprehensive testing procedures to verify that the Veracode MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server is working correctly in your environment.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Environment Setup
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Valid Veracode API credentials
- Access to at least one Veracode application

### 2. API Credentials Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```env
VERACODE_API_ID=your_api_id_here
VERACODE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Optional: Enable debug logging for detailed execution flow
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

**Note**: Your API credentials must have appropriate permissions to access applications and scan results.

## Quick Verification Tests

### Test 1: Build and Basic Connection
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Test API connection
npm run test:connection
```

**Expected Result**: 
- âœ… Build completes without errors
- âœ… Lists applications from your Veracode account
- âœ… Shows application details (GUID, business criticality, teams)

### Test 2: Application Search
```bash
# Search for applications (replace "Test" with a term that matches your apps)
node examples/query-apps.js "Test"
```

**Expected Result**:
- âœ… Finds and lists matching applications
- âœ… Shows application metadata
- âœ… No error messages

### Test 3: List All Available Applications
```bash
# Using the example script directly
node examples/list-apps.js
```

**Expected Result**:
- âœ… Lists all applications you have access to
- âœ… Provides guidance for running other examples
- âœ… Shows complete application metadata

## Comprehensive MCP Server Tests

### Test 4: Start MCP Server
```bash
npm run start
```

**Expected Result**:
- âœ… Server starts without errors
- âœ… Shows "Veracode MCP Server listening on stdio"
- âœ… No connection errors to Veracode API

**Note**: The MCP server runs in stdio mode for integration with MCP clients. Press Ctrl+C to stop.

### Test 5: MCP Tools Verification

The server provides these tools that can be tested via MCP clients:

1. **get-applications** - List all applications
2. **search-applications** - Search applications by name
3. **get-application-details** - Get detailed application information
4. **get-scan-results** - Get scan results for an application
5. **get-findings** - **UNIFIED FINDINGS TOOL** - Get security findings with intelligent filtering and pagination
   - Basic overview: First 300 findings by severity 
   - Filtered mode: Apply filters and pagination
6. **get-latest-sca-results** - Get latest SCA scan results
7. **get-sca-results-by-name** - **ðŸŽ¯ COMPREHENSIVE SCA** - Get detailed SCA analysis by application name
8. **get-sca-summary-by-name** - Get high-level SCA overview with risk metrics
9. **get-sca-apps** - List all applications with SCA scanning enabled
10. **get-comprehensive-sca-analysis** - Detailed SCA analysis with exploitability data

## SCA-Specific Testing

### Test 6: Find Applications with SCA Scans
```bash
# Find all apps with SCA scans
node examples/find-sca-apps.js

# Find specific apps with SCA scans
node examples/find-sca-apps.js "YourAppFilter"
```

**Expected Result**:
- âœ… Lists applications that have SCA scans
- âœ… Shows SCA scan metadata
- âœ… Provides summary of findings

### Test 7: Get SCA Results (if you have apps with SCA scans)
```bash
# Using the new comprehensive CLI tool (RECOMMENDED)
node build/veracode-mcp-client.js get-sca-results-by-name --name "YourAppName"

# With filtering options
node build/veracode-mcp-client.js get-sca-results-by-name --name "YourAppName" --severity_gte 4 --only_exploitable true

# Using the example script (alternative)
node examples/get-sca-results.js "YourAppName"

# Enable debug logging to see detailed execution flow
LOG_LEVEL=debug node build/veracode-mcp-client.js get-sca-results-by-name --name "YourAppName"
```

**Expected Result**:
- âœ… Finds the specified application
- âœ… Retrieves comprehensive SCA analysis including:
  - Vulnerability details with CVE information
  - Exploitability data and risk scores
  - Component analysis and licensing information
  - Severity breakdown and policy violations
- âœ… With debug logging: Shows detailed API calls, timing, and data processing steps

## Important Notes About SCA Integration

### SCA and Static Analysis Relationship
**Key Point**: SCA (Software Composition Analysis) results are generated as part of Veracode's static analysis process, not as separate scans.

**What This Means for Testing**:
- SCA findings appear in `STATIC` scan types
- Applications with static scans may contain both SAST and SCA findings
- The `get-scan-results` tool with `scan_type: "SCA"` filters findings, not scan types
- SCA-specific tools work by analyzing findings within static scans

**Testing Implications**:
- Look for applications with `STATIC` scans when testing SCA functionality
- SCA findings will be mixed with static analysis findings in the same scan
- Use SCA-specific tools to filter and analyze composition analysis results

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: "Missing API credentials"
**Symptoms**: Error message about missing credentials
**Solution**: 
1. Verify `.env` file exists in project root
2. Check that `VERACODE_API_ID` and `VERACODE_API_KEY` are set
3. Ensure no extra spaces or quotes around values

### Issue 2: "No applications found"
**Symptoms**: Empty application list or search results
**Solution**:
1. Verify API credentials have correct permissions
2. Check if you're in the correct Veracode account/organization
3. Confirm applications exist in your account

### Issue 3: "No SCA scans found"
**Symptoms**: Applications listed but no SCA data
**Solution**:
1. Verify the application has completed SCA scans
2. Check that your API credentials have access to SCA results
3. Try with a different application that you know has SCA scans

### Issue 4: TypeScript compilation errors
**Symptoms**: Build fails with TypeScript errors
**Solution**:
1. Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed
2. Delete `node_modules` and `build` directories
3. Run `npm install` then `npm run build`

### Issue 5: Network connectivity issues
**Symptoms**: API timeout or connection errors
**Solution**:
1. Check internet connectivity
2. Verify you're not behind a restrictive firewall
3. Test API access directly via Veracode's web interface

### Issue 6: Debug logging not working
**Symptoms**: LOG_LEVEL=debug shows no debug output
**Solution**:
1. Ensure `LOG_LEVEL=debug` is set before the command: `LOG_LEVEL=debug node ...`
2. Add to `.env` file: `echo "LOG_LEVEL=debug" >> .env`
3. Verify the environment variable is set: `echo $LOG_LEVEL` (Linux/Mac) or `echo %LOG_LEVEL%` (Windows)
4. Look for debug output in stderr (error stream) - may appear as red text in some terminals

### Issue 7: SCA CLI tool not available
**Symptoms**: "get-sca-results-by-name" command not found
**Solution**:
1. Ensure project is built: `npm run build`
2. Use full path: `node build/veracode-mcp-client.js get-sca-results-by-name --name "AppName"`
3. Check that build directory contains updated files: `ls -la build/`

### Test 8: Debug Logging Verification
```bash
# Test debug logging with any CLI command
LOG_LEVEL=debug node build/veracode-mcp-client.js get-applications

# Test with SCA analysis for comprehensive debug output
LOG_LEVEL=debug node build/veracode-mcp-client.js get-sca-results-by-name --name "YourAppName"

# Test different log levels
LOG_LEVEL=info node build/veracode-mcp-client.js get-applications
LOG_LEVEL=warn node build/veracode-mcp-client.js get-applications
LOG_LEVEL=error node build/veracode-mcp-client.js get-applications
```

**Expected Result**:
- âœ… **DEBUG level**: Shows detailed execution flow including:
  - API request URLs, response codes, and data sizes
  - Application search and matching logic
  - Timing information for each operation
  - Data processing and analysis steps
- âœ… **INFO level**: Shows normal operational messages
- âœ… **WARN level**: Shows warnings and errors only
- âœ… **ERROR level**: Shows only error messages

**Example Debug Output**:
```
[2025-07-12T21:10:09.259Z] DEBUG [API]: Getting findings by application name
  Data: { "name": "YourApp", "options": { "scanType": "SCA" } }
[2025-07-12T21:10:09.648Z] DEBUG [CLIENT]: API Response received
  Data: { "method": "GET", "status": 200, "dataSize": 2174, "executionTime": 389 }
```

## VS Code Integration Testing

### Test 9: VS Code Tasks
If using VS Code:
1. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Type "Tasks: Run Task"
3. Test available tasks:
   - "Build Veracode MCP Server"
   - "Test Veracode Connection"
   - "Example: Get SCA Results (Custom App)"
   - "Example: Find SCA Apps"

**Expected Result**:
- âœ… All tasks execute without errors
- âœ… Custom app task prompts for application name
- âœ… Results display in integrated terminal
- âœ… SCA-specific tasks work correctly

## Performance Verification

### Test 10: Large Dataset Handling
```bash
# Test with applications that have many findings
node examples/get-sca-results.js "AppWithManyFindings"

# Test with the CLI tool
node build/veracode-mcp-client.js get-sca-results-by-name --name "AppWithManyFindings"

# Test with debug logging to see performance metrics
LOG_LEVEL=debug node build/veracode-mcp-client.js get-sca-results-by-name --name "AppWithManyFindings"
```

**Expected Result**:
- âœ… Handles large result sets gracefully
- âœ… Provides filtering options to limit results appropriately
- âœ… Completes within reasonable time (< 30 seconds)
- âœ… Debug logging shows timing and performance data

## Security Verification

### Test 10: Credential Security
1. Verify `.env` file is in `.gitignore`
2. Check that credentials don't appear in logs
3. Confirm API calls use VERACODE-HMAC-SHA-256 authentication

**Expected Result**:
- âœ… No credentials visible in terminal output
- âœ… Authentication headers properly formatted
- âœ… Secure credential handling

## Integration Testing with MCP Clients
