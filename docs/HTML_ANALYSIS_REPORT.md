# Veracode API HTML Content Analysis & Resolution

## Investigation Summary

### What Was Found ✅
The Veracode API **correctly returns JSON responses**, but **intentionally includes HTML formatting** in vulnerability description fields. This is Veracode's standard approach for providing rich formatting in vulnerability descriptions.

### API Response Analysis
- **Endpoint**: `/appsec/v2/applications/{guid}/findings` 
- **Response Format**: Valid JSON
- **HTML Content**: Embedded in `description` fields (intentional)
- **Scope**: Primarily STATIC analysis findings
- **Purpose**: Rich formatting for vulnerability details and reference links

### Example Raw API Response
```json
{
  "description": "<span>This call to strcat() contains a buffer overflow. If the length of the source buffer exceeds the length of user-controlled destination buffer contents, the overflow may result in execution of arbitrary code.</span> <span>Use precision specifiers for all string placeholders.</span> <span>References: <a href=\"http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html\">CWE</a> <a href=\"http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Buffer_Overflow\">OWASP</a></span>"
}
```

### HTML Elements Found
- `<span>` tags for content sections and formatting
- `<a href="">` tags for clickable reference links (CWE, OWASP, WASC)
- Structured formatting for vulnerability details and guidance

## Resolution: Preserve Trusted API Responses ✅

### Design Decision
**HTML cleaning was initially implemented but then removed** based on the principle that the Veracode API is a trusted source and should not be modified.

### Current Implementation
- ✅ **No HTML stripping** - Responses preserved exactly as provided by Veracode
- ✅ **Full content preservation** - All formatting and links maintained  
- ✅ **Trusted source principle** - Veracode API responses passed through unchanged
- ✅ **Rich content support** - Clickable links to CWE, OWASP, WASC preserved

### Architecture Flow
```
Veracode API → REST Client → MCP Client → End User
     (HTML)      (unchanged)   (unchanged)    (HTML)
```

## Current Behavior ✅

### Response Format
**Raw API Response** (preserved):
```
<span>This call to strcat() contains a buffer overflow...</span> <span>References: <a href="http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html">CWE</a></span>
```

**MCP Client Response** (identical):
```
<span>This call to strcat() contains a buffer overflow...</span> <span>References: <a href="http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html">CWE</a></span>
```

### Benefits
- **✅ Trusted source** - No modification of Veracode-provided content
- **✅ Rich formatting** - HTML spans and links preserved for better readability
- **✅ Clickable references** - Direct links to CWE, OWASP, WASC databases
- **✅ Full fidelity** - Complete preservation of Veracode's intended formatting

## Key Insights

### ✅ **API is Working as Designed**
- Veracode API returns valid JSON with intentional HTML formatting
- HTML content provides rich text formatting and reference linking
- This is the expected and proper behavior

### ✅ **Trust-Based Architecture**  
- Veracode API treated as trusted source
- No data modification or "sanitization" performed
- Original content integrity maintained

### ✅ **User Experience**
- Preserves intended formatting and styling
- Maintains clickable reference links
- Respects Veracode's content design decisions

## Current Status

The MCP server now **preserves all HTML content** from Veracode API responses, treating them as trusted and authoritative. This approach maintains content fidelity and respects Veracode's intentional formatting choices.
