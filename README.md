# Veracode MCP Server and 💻 **Command-Line Client** (for scripts & automation)
- All the same tools available via command-line interface
- Perfect for CI/CD pipelines, scripts, and automated workflows

> 🔍 **Read-Only Focus**: This server provides **read-only access** to Veracode data. It does not support creating, modifying, or deleting applications, scans, or findings. This design ensures safe integration with AI assistants and automation workflows without risk of unintended changes to your Veracode account.

> ⚠️ **DISCLAIMER**: This is an **unofficial**, **unsupported**, and **work-in-progress** project. This is not an official Veracode product and is not supported by Veracode. Use at your own risk. This project is for educational and experimental purposes only.

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with the Veracode API to provide AI assistants and automation tools with read-only access to application security information, scan results, and compliance data.

> ✅ **Production Ready**: Fully functional MCP server for Claude Desktop integration with comprehensive SCA analysis capabilities.

## 📸 Example: SCA Analysis

![Veracode MCP Client Test Run](images/test.png)

This example shows comprehensive SCA analysis capabilities:
- ✅ Real-time connection to Veracode API
- 🔍 Software composition analysis with vulnerability details
- 🚨 Critical vulnerability identification with EPSS scores
- ⚠️ License risk assessment and policy violations
- 📋 Detailed component and dependency analysis

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dipsylala/VeracodeMCP.git
cd VeracodeMCP
npm install
npm run build
```

### 2. Configuration
Create a `.env` file with your Veracode API credentials:
```env
VERACODE_API_ID=your-api-id-here
VERACODE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### 3. Verification
```bash
# Test your setup
npm run example:list-apps

# Get comprehensive SCA analysis
npm run example:sca-results
```

### 4. Claude Desktop Integration
Add to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "veracode": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["build/index.js"],
      "cwd": "/absolute/path/to/VeracodeMCP",
      "env": {
        "VERACODE_API_ID": "your-api-id",
        "VERACODE_API_KEY": "your-api-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then restart Claude Desktop and ask: *"What SCA vulnerabilities do I have in my applications?"*

## 🔑 Getting Veracode API Credentials

1. Log in to your Veracode account
2. Go to **Account Settings** > **API Credentials**
3. Generate a new API ID and Key pair
4. Ensure the credentials have **read permissions** for:
   - Applications
   - Scan Results  
   - Findings
   - Policy Compliance

> 💡 **Note**: Only **read permissions** are required. This server performs no write operations.
